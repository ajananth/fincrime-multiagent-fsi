# Financial Crime & Suspicious Matter Reporting - LLM-based Agentic Solution

This sample code has been put together to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in being able to detect money laundering and other financial crime related activities. The example demonstrates the use of LLM-based agents to identify suspicious activities from a call-centre log and draft a suspicious matter report.

The solution is based on the multi-agent framework using the Azure OpenAI Assistant API as described here - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/building-a-multimodal-multi-agent-framework-with-azure-openai/ba-p/4084007

## Sample Output
### Below is a sample output generated by the process when a fictitious call-centre log was analysed by the agents

To ensure that the Suspicious Matter Report (SMR) captures all points mentioned in the summary:

**Points in Summary of Suspicious Activities:**
1. Lack of Standard Identification
2. Inconsistent Information
3. No Phone for Verification
4. Urgency and Pressure
5. Large International Transfers
6. Transfers to Charities Without Adequate Information
7. Defensive Response

**Verification Against SMR:**

1. **Lack of Standard Identification:** The SMR addresses this point in Section III, Item 1. "Identification Issue: Subject failed to provide standard identification initially; eventually used a passport for ID."
2. **Inconsistent Information:** Addressed in Section III, Item 2. "Account Number Discrepancy: Incorrect account number provided, later corrected."
3. **No Phone for Verification:** Included in Section III, Item 3. "Phone Number for Verification: Subject claimed to lack a phone, evading a key security control."
4. **Urgency and Pressure:** Mentioned in Section III, Item 4. "Urgent Transfer Requests: Subject stressed immediate action for international transfers, pressuring to circumvent normal processes."
5. **Large International Transfers:** Captured in Section III, Item 5. "Large International Transactions: Subject requested transfers of significant amounts to international beneficiaries."
6. **Transfers to Charities Without Adequate Information:** Addressed in Section III, Item 6. "Transfers to Charities: Subject was vague about recipient charities and unable to provide detailed information when asked."
7. **Defensive Response:** Documented in Section III, Item 7. "Defensive Behavior: Subject displayed a defensive attitude when queried about the urgency of the transactions."

The Suspicious Matter Report (SMR) comprehensively includes all the points mentioned in the summary provided by the reviewer_assistant assistant, thereby capturing the full extent of the suspicious activities noted during the interaction with the customer in question.

### Summary of Suspicious Activities:

1. Lack of Standard Identification: Alex Tracer, the customer, was unable to provide a standard form of identification such as an ATM card number or driver’s license, claiming to have lost the former and to be in the process of acquiring the latter. He eventually provided a passport ID for identification.

2. Inconsistent Information: Alex Tracer initially provided an incorrect account number, which he then corrected. This could indicate a lack of familiarity with the account details or an attempt to deceive.

3. No Phone for Verification: Despite the bank operator, Adam Krivy, attempting to complete an authentication process with a verification code sent to a mobile number, Alex claimed not to have a phone, thus avoiding this security measure.

4. Urgency and Pressure: The customer repeatedly stressed the urgency of the transfers, claiming lives were at risk and expressing a strong desire to avoid bank bureaucracy, thereby trying to rush the process and potentially bypass standard security checks.

5. Large International Transfers: Alex requested three large-sum transfers to different international organizations, which could raise flags as this activity could be indicative of money laundering or fraudulent activities. 

6. Transfers to Charities Without Adequate Information: The customer mentioned transferring money to various charities, one of which he could not provide additional information for, asking the operator to look it up. A genuine transfer would typically involve more details and accompanying documentation.

7. Defensive Response: When questioned about the urgency of the transfers, Alex Tracer defensively responded that it was none of the operator’s business, further raising suspicion about the legitimacy of the request.

Based on these observations, the interaction between Alex Tracer and the bank operator exhibits several red flags that could suggest potential fraudulent activity or an attempt to misuse the banking system for illicit purposes.
